# Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns
This repository is a library of common design patterns for Office Add-ins. It represents a set of best practices for add-in interfaces. The patterns are built using Office UI Fabric components and styling. They complement Office experiences and follow add-in UX design principles. As you design your own Office Add-in, refer to the patterns or download the templates to quickly create your own mock-ups.

##Tips & Tricks
* These are vector files produced with Adobe Illustrator or .ai.
* The files are produced at 200% size to accommodate high resolution screens.
* All pattern files contain simplified versions of the Office applications in the background. Refer to the helpful add-in templates for more accurate backgrounds.
* When designing with these assets please keep the following in mind:
 * Copy Add-in UI from a pattern file and place into the Office Add-in template of your choice.
 * Icon assets have been converted to outlines and reproduced at 200% to match
 * Font sizes similarly produced at 200%: 11pt = 22pt
 * Some files contained linked files. These references are contained in a folder named "Embedded Backgrounds"
 * Some common elements used across files have been created as symbols. These are contained in the "Embedded Symbols" folder.
